        <p>Develop a Comprehensive Business Plan
        Every business needs a plan. It helps you gain better clarity about what you mean to achieve. Do you want to start a real estate business to increase your income? Or are you looking for a career change? Or maybe it’s something you want to do on the side. Your reason will affect your business because real estate is a round-the-clock venture. You need to be available at all times for your client. Understand why you are starting the business.
        
        Next, you need the actual plan—your business plan. It gives you direction and helps you and your potential investors understand your goals and the milestones you hope to achieve. A properly drafted business plan helps you get loans from the bank if you really need any.
        
        Conduct Thorough Market Research
        Conduct market research. There may be a rising need for green homes, or perhaps the university in your city needs more residential spaces. Researching will help you decide the sector to specialize in. Educate yourself on the aspects of real estate. If you are completely new to this, consider finding a mentor to help you initially. He/she may aid you in finding contacts, giving you a running list of dos and don’ts, whom to target, and so on.
        
        Apart from choosing a type of real estate to deal with, you also need to decide your specialty, which can be anything like residential brokerage, land development, property management, etc. Select the specialty you have the most knowledge about. You can add to your job titles as you gain experience.
